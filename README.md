# Analog Clock

## Project Description

This project is a simple analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands that update in real-time.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you need a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the clock.
- `analogclock.css`: The CSS file that styles the clock.
- `analogclock.js`: The JavaScript file that powers the clock's functionality.

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PadmalathaKasireddy/analog-clock.git
    cd analog-clock
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

    or simply double-click the `index.html` file.

The analog clock will be displayed, and the time will update every second.

## Model Training

This project does not involve any machine learning model training. It is a static web application that uses JavaScript to update the time in real-time.

## Results

The project displays a functioning analog clock that accurately shows the current time. The hour, minute, and second hands rotate to reflect the current time, updating every second.
